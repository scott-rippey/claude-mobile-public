## 2026-02-11
Built full CC Interface project: Express server (cc-server) with auth middleware, file browsing, and Claude Agent SDK chat streaming on port 3002; Next.js frontend with file browser, file viewer, chat interface, and NextAuth Google OAuth setup. Restructured project — moved Next.js app to repo root for Vercel, cc-server stays as subfolder. Fixed Vercel build (excluded cc-server from tsconfig/eslint). Deployed to Vercel (claudemobile-sigma.vercel.app), bought claudemobile.dev domain, created Cloudflare Tunnel (api.claudemobile.dev -> localhost:3002). Added terminal backend route (SSE streaming bash commands) and tabbed project workspace (/project/[project]) with Browse, Terminal, and File tabs using CSS hidden for state persistence. Downgraded Next.js 16 to 15.5.12 — v16 deprecated middleware.ts convention which broke Google auth entirely. Added logout button, robust terminal error handling with console.error debugging. Next: restart cc-server on iMac to load terminal route, verify terminal commands work end-to-end.
