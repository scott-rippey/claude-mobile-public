# v1.2.0 Test Tracking

Temporary file — delete after merge to main.

## Remaining Tests

### 7. Fork Button
- [ ] Fork button (branch icon) should appear in header once a session is active
- [ ] Tap it, send a different message, verify it's a separate conversation
- **Status:** Button exists in code (`ChatInterface.tsx:974-984`), shows when `sessionId` exists and not streaming. Appears in header next to "New" button.
- **Notes:** Fork = branch the conversation. Creates a copy of the current session so you can explore an alternate path without losing the original thread.

### 8. Graceful Interrupt
- [ ] Send "Write a 500 word essay about dogs"
- [ ] Tap Stop once → should show "Interrupting..." (Claude finishes current thought)
- [ ] Tap again within 3s → hard stop (immediate kill)

### 9. Session Persistence
- [ ] Start a chat, note the session
- [ ] Restart cc-server (Ctrl+C and `npm run dev` again)
- [ ] Send another message → should continue the same session (not start fresh)

### 10. File Checkpointing
- [ ] Create a test file in the project dir: `echo "hello" > test.txt`
- [ ] Ask Claude "edit test.txt and add a second line"
- [ ] After it edits, an Undo button should appear in the header (amber colored, left of Fork)
- [ ] Tap Undo → file should revert to before the edit
