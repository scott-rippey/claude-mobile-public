# v1.2.0 Test Tracking

Temporary file — delete after merge to main.

## Remaining Tests

### 7. Fork Button — REMOVED
- **Status:** Removed from UI. Fork works at the SDK level but without a session switcher there's no way to navigate between forked/original sessions, making the button confusing. Server-side `forkSession` support remains for future use.

### 8. Graceful Interrupt
- [ ] Send "Write a 500 word essay about dogs"
- [ ] Tap Stop once → should show "Interrupting..." (Claude finishes current thought)
- [ ] Tap again within 3s → hard stop (immediate kill)

### 9. Session Persistence
- [ ] Start a chat, note the session
- [ ] Restart cc-server (Ctrl+C and `npm run dev` again)
- [ ] Send another message → should continue the same session (not start fresh)

### 10. File Checkpointing + Undo — REMOVED
- **Status:** Removed Undo button from UI. SDK's `rewindFiles()` only works on an active Query object — once Claude finishes responding, the query is gone and rewind can't be called. Server-side route and checkpointing logic remain for future use if SDK adds persistent session support.
